Welcome!

This software aims to assist in plotting houses in a user-provided region of space. This works with shapefiles and has its own method of generating them, but users are welcome to submit their own.

The house plotter currently generates rows of houses parallel to the longest edge of the given region. I plan to put the software into a website for easier usability and then focus on optimising with iterative padding.

The Prototype branches each serve their own purpose regarding this project, with more details in PLAN.txt. P1 is for creating user-defined houses, P2 is for generating house polygons and plotting them within the region, P3 is for optimisation of house placement (hopefully with regard to roads), and P4 is for providing a map (for user shapefile generation) and for building the website. Chronologically, the order was actually P4->P1->P2->P4(for the website)->P3.

Any references to roads are, for now, obsolete, as they are currently considered non-essential.

Feel free to browse the python files!



To plot a region without using the website:
*First, install the contents of the requirements.txt file.
*Next, add in your own housetypes or use the default ones provided in "PlotOptimals.py".
*Finally, run "PlotOptimals.py" to draw the regions!
