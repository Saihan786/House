PROTOTYPE 1:
* be able to add stuff to a pandas dataframe
* that's literally it

* first be able to add literally anything to a graph (pandas dataframe)
* then figure out how to make houses in terms of graph data
* then put them on the axes by plotting
* figure out how to plot with constraints: between the red line boundary lines, road/house constraints, entrance area
* Self-drawing is just randomised plotting
* at this point we can move on to Prototype 2, which is finding the optimal plot


PROTOTYPE 4:
* "RedLinePlot.py"
* Call "makeEmptyMap()" to open a web page containing a world map (not yet real time)
* Select the polygon option on the map to draw a polygon (red line plot), then export this as a .geojson file (should be more intuitive on a website)
* Call "openRLP()" with path to the .geojson file as a parameter to create a graph of the red line plot
* All that's left for this prototype is to put it on a website, non-essential task
