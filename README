PROTOTYPE 1:
* be able to add stuff to a pandas dataframe
* that's literally it

* first be able to add literally anything to a graph (pandas dataframe)
* then figure out how to make houses in terms of graph data
* then put them on the axes by plotting
* figure out how to plot with constraints: between the red line boundary lines, road/house constraints, entrance area
* Self-drawing is just randomised plotting
* at this point we can move on to Prototype 2, which is finding the optimal plot
