PROTOTYPE 1:


PROTOTYPE 4:
* "RedLinePlot.py"
* Call "makeEmptyMap()" to open a web page containing a world map (not yet real time)
* Select the polygon option on the map to draw a polygon (red line plot), then export this as a .geojson file (should be more intuitive on a website)
* Call "openRLP()" with path to the .geojson file as a parameter to create a graph of the red line plot
* All that's left for this prototype is to put it on a website, non-essential task
